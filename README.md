    - Templates for creating consistent documentation for your machine learning projects
    - Best practices for versioning and tracking your machine learning models
    - Tools for automating the building, testing, and deployment of your models
    - Guidelines for managing your machine learning infrastructure
    - Best practices for monitoring and maintaining your models in production
